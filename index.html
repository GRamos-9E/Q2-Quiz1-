				<p class="text-start"> Apolinario is a devout Catholic who was a victim of racial discrimination by the Spanish led Catholic Church. Pule was angered at the Church for refusing to bury his dead brother only because of them being "Indio" or a native Filipino. In retaliation, he established the Confradia De San Jose which was a Catholic organization only made for Indios. The organization focused on the values of personalities such as St. Francis of Asisi and the Virgin of Antipolo while also merging Catholic and native beliefs with items such as "anting-anting". The Church was angry at Pule as they considered it heresy and refused to recognize the Confradia. Pule decided there was no choice but to revolt. The revolt lasted quite some time until officials caught Pule, put his head on a pike, and displayed it as a warning to those who will defy Espana. This revolt is a sign of courage as he defied the Church and stood up for his people and beliefs. </p>

		<td><p class="text-start">Gregorio Del Pilar was a military general under the first president of the Philippines, Emilio Aguinaldo. He comes from the same family as the famous ilustrado Marcelo Del Pilar. He helped Marcelo before distibuting his pamphlets that critique the Spanish government and the Church for their unfair actions. Goyo studied at the Ateneo De Manila University and later on joined the Katipunan. While in the Katipunan, he learned military tactics and how to be a good soldier. He was one of the main generals of the First Philippine Republic led by Emilio Aguinaldo. He was excelling very well and rising through the ranks with his skills as a general but mostly through his connection with Aguinaldo. While the Americans pursued Aguinaldo, the remaining forces of the Philippine Army stayed behind to keep the Americans at bay to give the government, time to escape. The Battle of Tirad Pass started off well for the Filipinos with them using the mountains as a high ground and kept the Americans at bay. US forces then ran into a native who eventually led them through a shortcut that gave the loss to the Philippine army. One particular American Sniper aimed at Goyo and shot him in the neck.</p></td>
